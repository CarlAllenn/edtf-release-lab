# Publish the six per-crate releases, last, once every asset is attached —
# one at a time, verifying immutability before moving to the next.
#
# Phase 1 creates them as drafts (`git_release_draft` in release-plz.toml,
# and `--draft` in tag-release.sh for the dispatch recovery path). This step
# is what makes them public.
#
# Why drafts at all: immutability is enforced at PUBLISH, not at creation.
# GitHub's guidance is create-as-draft, attach every asset, then publish —
# and the previous shape did the opposite, publishing in phase 1 and
# attaching SBOMs in phase 2 with `gh release upload --clobber`. With
# immutability on, that clobber is refused and the release cannot be
# completed at all. It is the better shape independently: a release that
# strands now leaves nothing public, and assets appear with the release.
#
# Why one at a time. A release published while the repository's
# immutable-releases setting is off stays mutable PERMANENTLY — `gh release
# edit` cannot retrofit it and re-dispatching cannot either. The obvious
# guard would be a precondition reading
# `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/immutable-releases`, but that is a repository
# settings read: `administration` is not a grantable workflow permission
# scope, so GITHUB_TOKEN cannot be given access to it. Checking the setting
# from CI is therefore not available.
#
# So the check is made against the only thing this job can observe — a
# release it has just published — and the blast radius is bounded by doing
# them sequentially. If the setting is off, exactly ONE release is mutable
# and the run stops; the other five stay drafts and publish correctly once
# the setting is enabled and the tag is re-dispatched.
#
# Operators can check the setting directly before releasing (admin rights
# required); the runbook records the call.
#
# Idempotent, like every other step: an already-published release is left
# alone, so re-dispatching at the tag converges rather than erroring.
