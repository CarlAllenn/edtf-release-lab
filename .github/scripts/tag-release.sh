# Recovery path (issue #66): create the per-crate tags and GitHub
# releases for the manifest version, from a workflow_dispatch on main.
#
# Why this exists: release-plz refuses to tag unless the current commit is a
# release-PR merge commit. Any defect discovered AFTER the release PR merges
# therefore leaves the release unrecoverable by the automated path — the
# fix lands as an ordinary PR, release-plz answers "current commit is not
# from a release PR", and re-running phase 1 is a no-op. This script is the
# way back: it does exactly what release-plz's release step would have done
# (per-crate tags + GitHub releases at the current commit), guarded so it
# can only ever act on a version that is bumped in the manifests but absent
# from both the registry and the tag namespace.
#
# It deliberately does NOT push the umbrella tag: that stays with
# push-umbrella-tag.sh, which runs right after this in the dispatch job and
# carries the PAT that publish.yml's trigger requires. This script runs with
# the default GITHUB_TOKEN — per-crate tags are meant to trigger nothing.

  # That is load-bearing here. push-umbrella-tag.sh, the very next step in
  # the dispatch job, decides whether a release is in flight by reading
  # refs/tags/edtf-core-v<version>. Before `--draft` this loop did create
  # the ref as a side effect of `gh release create --target` — v1.0.1 and
  # v1.0.2 are the lightweight refs it left behind. After `--draft` the ref
  # never appeared, the anchor lookup 404'd, push-umbrella-tag.sh reported
  # "no release in progress" and the whole dispatch job exited GREEN having
  # triggered nothing, with six invisible drafts and no way to converge:
  # a re-dispatch finds the drafts present and skips.
  #
  # So the ref is created explicitly and first, and the release is created
  # against it. That also makes the TAG_SHA guard above meaningful on the
