# Attach the CLI tarballs and SHA256SUMS to the lab-cli release.
#
# Per-crate, like the SBOMs and the extension tarballs: these artifacts are
# lab-cli and nothing else, so they belong on that crate's release.
# SHA256SUMS is the shared manifest from checksum-artifacts.sh — it also
# names the extension tarballs, and it is attached to both releases so each
# artifact's release carries the checksums that describe it.
#
# REPLACES rather than skips, while the release is a draft — the same
# reasoning as upload-extension-assets.sh: a re-dispatched run rebuilds the
# binaries, the bytes are not claimed reproducible, and SHA256SUMS is
# regenerated over the new bytes. Skipping by name would leave a release
# whose checksums file contradicts its own assets.
#
# Once a release is published it is immutable and nothing can be attached.
# That is not recoverable in place, so it fails loudly rather than pretending.
